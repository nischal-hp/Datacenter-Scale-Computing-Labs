# Datacenter-Scale-Computing-Labs

All the labs were done using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for the course CSCI 5253 : Datacenter Scale Computing.

The course covers the primary problem solving strategies, methods, and tools needed for data-intensive programs using large collections of computers typically called as "warehouse scale" or "data-center scale" computers. The course also examines methods and algorithms for processing data-intensive applications, methods for deploying and managing large collections of computers in an on-demand infrastructure and issues of large-scale computer system design.

## Content of Labs 
1. A quick setup of the Google Cloud Platform
2. Converting WordCount Map-Reduce example to URLCount using Hadoop
3. Chain Mappers/Reducers application using Hadoop on Google Cloud Platform
4. Application that demonstrates PySpark and Python's DataFrame (DF) functions
5. Demonstrate the construction of VM instances on Google Cloud Platform programmatically.
6. Compare the REST and GRPC API calls for their latency and bandwidth on Google Cloud Platform
